# hello-world
my first time in gitHub


I am Nino and I graduated 2 years course in computer. I love working on computer as a hobby only. Im not that expert but I can do hardware troubleshooting. I didn't pursue my skills to used it on a job. My job is opposite today, I am only doing administrative task which is making me bored always.

I always thinking of becoming a programmer but due to no afford going to degree in college, I did not.

While surfing in the internet I seen the codecademy.com and when i tried it.. It is very helpfull and I can easily follow the steps on every lesson discuss.

As of this writing its been a week since I started learning JAVASCRIPT. I hope to learn more and become programmer even if I am already 30. :D
